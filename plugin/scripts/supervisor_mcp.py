"""MCP server: simulated human supervisor.

Exposes a single tool, `consult_supervisor(question)`. The tool
synchronously calls a small LLM (default deepseek-v4-flash) that has
read access to the FULL original simulation specification for the
current task. The LLM is instructed to answer concisely using only
information present in the spec, and never to volunteer information
the agent did not ask about.

Spec source:
  Path is read from the env var SUPERVISOR_SPEC_PATH. The file is
  loaded once at process start and held only in this process's memory.
  Set in mcp-config so it does not appear in the docker `-e` list, and
  mounted at a path outside `/workspace`.

LLM endpoint:
  OpenAI-compatible. Defaults: base_url=https://api.deepseek.com/v1,
  model=deepseek-v4-flash. Override via SUPERVISOR_LLM_BASE_URL,
  SUPERVISOR_LLM_MODEL. API key from SUPERVISOR_LLM_API_KEY (preferred)
  or DEEPSEEK_API_KEY.

Telemetry:
  Every call appends a JSON line to /workspace/supervisor_calls.jsonl
  (if /workspace exists). Records the question, answer, latency, and
  token counts. The agent does not see this file.

You are the human researcher who wrote the simulation specification
shown below. An AI assistant is helping you author the simulation
inputs. The assistant only saw a relaxed version of your spec — some
details were intentionally omitted from what they received.

When the assistant asks you a question:
- Answer concisely (1–3 sentences).
- Use only information that is present in the specification. If the
  answer is not in the specification, say so plainly. Do not invent.
- DO NOT volunteer information the assistant did not ask about. Stay
  on the question.
- Do not name GEOS XML tag or attribute names unless the assistant
  named them first; speak in the same scientific language the
  specification uses.
- If the question is vague, ask one short clarifying question rather
  than guessing.

Original specification:
